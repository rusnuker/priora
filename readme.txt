PRIORA trojan 2.0
Previous name: ABOBUS
DISCLAIMER: THIS IS MALWARE! DO NOT EXECUTE THIS CODE IF NOT SURE WHAT IT DOES!
THIS CODE CAN OVERWRITE FILE SYSTEM! 

Warning: code is so dirty and bad-formatted. Sorry bout that!
Also sorry for mistakes in comments. I'm russian and didn't use translator.

This malware was tested so many times (like about 100 releases!) on Computernewb UserVM.
This trojan even has it's own wiki https://computernewb.com/wiki/ABOBUS
made by someone who hates shitware so much.
To transfer malware to UserVM i used Ngrok and local web server. Wiki's creator was so fast,
he stole my malware faster than i be able to close session. So he posted this malware on wiki.
By the way: mbr.exe was not PRIORA release. It is locker made by me for some forkie.

If you wanna test malware on virtual machine -- 
you can download release from Github.
